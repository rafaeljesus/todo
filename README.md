## Todo App

* Todo is a sample praxis api server
* A minimal docker alpine container
* Automatically pushes it to dockerhub if tests pass

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaeljesus/todo.git
cd todo
bundle
bundle exec rackup
```

## Docker
This repository has automated image builds on hub.docker.com after successfully building and testing. See the `deployment` section of [circle.yml](circle.yml) for details on how this is done. Note that three environment variables need to be set on CircleCI for the deployment to work:

  * DOCKER_EMAIL - The email address associated with the user with push access to the Docker Hub repository
  * DOCKER_USER - Docker Hub username
  * DOCKER_PASS - Docker Hub password (these are all stored encrypted on CircleCI, and you can create a deployment user with limited permission on Docker Hub if you like)

run:
```
$ docker-machine start default
$ eval $(docker-machine env default)
$ docker-compose up
```
